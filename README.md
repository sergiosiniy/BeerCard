It's my small home project.

One can find some beer and read about it, check the other 
user's rates of this beer or rate it.
Also One can send me a beer by mail if there is no such beer in database of the app.
Beers are sorted by types like Light Lagger, Bock, Red Ale etc.

There is no DB connection (and beers respectively), search of beer and rates for a while.
Even the UI looks ugly.
But I'm learning how to do all that things well.
So... Just be patient :)
